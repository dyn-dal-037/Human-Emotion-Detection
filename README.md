# Human Emotion Detection

This repository implements a **human emotion detection system** using deep learning on facial images. The project focuses on classifying basic human emotions from facial expressions using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **transfer learning**, with an emphasis on model interpretability.

---

## Overview

The system takes facial images as input and predicts the corresponding emotional state. In addition to classification, the project explores **model interpretability** using **Grad-CAM** to visualize which facial regions contribute most to the model’s predictions.

This work serves as a practical study of **computer vision pipelines**, **deep learning training workflows**, and **explainable AI techniques**.
